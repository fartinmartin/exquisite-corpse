<sup>⚠️ This is an "experimental" branch—watch me (eventually) convert [exquisite corpse club](https://github.com/fartinmartin/exquisite-corpse) to a Next.js app using React.js!</sup>

# exquisite corpse club™

- [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/RNg8lCVQnMU5HAeYxu03UT/exquisite-corpse-club?node-id=40%3A25&scaling=min-zoom)
- [TODOs](https://trello.com/b/JmK3HtwP/exquisite-corpse-club™)
- [Case study](https://www.martinlindberg.me/exquisite-corpse-club/)

## The _what_ club?

An exquisite corpse is a collaborative drawing made up of three sections. Each section is drawn by a different artist who can’t see the other sections. The results are sometimes strange but always entertaining. I adapted this analog collaborative drawing game for the remote world of 2020!

## The tech deets

The exquisite corpse club™ is a progressive web app built with React.js, Next.js, and Google Firebase.

## Build setup

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
