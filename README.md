## The _what_ club?

An exquisite corpse is a collaborative drawing made up of three sections. Each section is drawn by a different artist who can’t see the other sections. The results are sometimes strange but always entertaining. I adapted this analog collaborative drawing game for the remote world of 2020!

## The tech deets

The exquisite corpse club™ is a progressive web app built with React.js, Next.js, and Google Firebase.

## Build setup

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
