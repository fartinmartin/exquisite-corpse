## The _what_ club?

An exquisite corpse is a collaborative drawing made up of three sections. Each section is drawn by a different artist who can’t see the other sections. The results are sometimes strange but always entertaining. I adapted this analog collaborative drawing game for the remote world of 2020!

## The tech deets

The exquisite corpse club™ is a progressive web app built with Vue.js, Nuxt.js, and Google Firebase.

## Build setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
